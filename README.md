# CMMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance using CLIP embeddings)
Unofficial PyTorch implementation of CMMD. 
CMMD is proposed in [!https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09603]Rethinking FID: Towards a Better Evaluation Metric for Image Generation. CMMD stands out to be a better metric than FID and tries to mitigate the longstanding issues of FID.
